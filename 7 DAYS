I finish my first web page with HTML,CSS and PHP.
it was very fun, taking information from:


-Youtube
-github
-stackoverflow
-w3 school
and more pages..

the procces about ID selectors was very hard on CSS, but i know how to do it right now!

php was very fun because:
i know how to make a file and write on it.
that was amazing for me, and very easy

and something very nice for me was doing the page working on phone.
that was a fun procces about css and "@media" variable.
i leave the repository about my FirstWebPage
