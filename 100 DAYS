# 100DAYS-programming
After 100 DAYS of programming progress, I could say that I have a lot of progress right now.
In the early days I had a lot of "bad practices" in programming. for instance:
use hardcoded styles in the html.
or use few functions and nest everything to just 1 function

I got to do 2 projects in which I was paid.
One was an Ecommerce store with responsive design.
And the other was a stock management and sales management project.

The method I used to learn was to practice, practice, and practice nonstop with motivation and effort,
searching for information in repositories and in stackoverflow. using ww3 to learn about css and javascript features.
